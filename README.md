# Neon

Hi, this is <span style="color:rgb(240,0,255)">**Neon**</span> - a toy language you didn't wait for.

## Why

Nobody needs another programming language. I just want to teach me two things.

- How to write a compiler and a virtual machine
- How to use Rust

So, I'm building <span style="color:rgb(240,0,255)">**Neon**</span>.

## State

Neon is in a very early stage and basically only an over-engineered calculator for now.

## Goal

The primary goal for me is to make Neon a self-hosted language. So want to get Neon to a state where I can rewrite the
language in Neon itself.

Additional goals might come up during the development - or not.

## Inspiration

At some point I stumbled across [Bob Nystrom](https://github.com/munificent)'s
book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/), and it really is one of the best books in tech.
If you haven't read it yet, and you're into building compilers & programming languages, go and get yourself a copy.

It's a fantastic read!

Said that Neon will not follow Lox, the language Bob created for the book, but I will definitely use Pratt Parsing üòÑ
Thanks Bob for teaching me this technique üôè
